# Message-Sender
You can send messages to people after you want them to send

I wanted this app for the purpose of being able to send msgs to people later than when I click 'send'.

The only issue is that without a private server and everbody using the same app the OS doesn't allow me to send messages programmatically.
The next best alternative is to have a reminder sent when you want to send said message.
